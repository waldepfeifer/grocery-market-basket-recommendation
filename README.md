## Project Overview

This project builds a product recommendation engine using association rule mining based on grocery transaction data.  
It leverages the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and generate actionable purchase suggestions based on a user’s basket.  
The system is implemented in Python using `mlxtend` for preprocessing and rule extraction.

## Objectives

- Load and clean real-world grocery transaction data  
- Encode transaction data using one-hot encoding  
- Use the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets  
- Generate association rules based on support and confidence thresholds  
- Recommend new items to users based on their current basket

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- mlxtend  
- TransactionEncoder (for one-hot encoding)  
- apriori (for frequent itemset generation)  
- association_rules (for rule mining)

## Project Structure

grocery-market-basket-recommendation/  
├── purchase_recommender_apriori.py       – Main script for data loading, mining, and recommending  
├── grocery_transactions.csv              – CSV file with real or simulated transactions  
├── README.md                             – Project documentation  

## Dataset Description

- File: grocery_transactions.csv  
- Format: Each row represents one customer’s basket  
- Columns: Variable number of columns depending on items per transaction  
- Missing values are ignored  

Example row:  
Bread, Milk, Eggs

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python and pip are installed  
2. Install dependencies:  
   pip install pandas mlxtend

3. Run the script with Python and provide input like:  
   from purchase_recommender_apriori import load_data, get_rules, recommend  
   basket = load_data()  
   rules = get_rules(basket)  
   recommend(rules, ['milk', 'bread'])

4. Output will be the most confident recommendation based on input basket

## Algorithm Details

- Minimum Support: 1%  
- Minimum Confidence: 1%  
- Recommendations are generated by selecting the rule with the highest confidence that matches the user's input basket (1 to 3 items)

## Example

Input: ['milk', 'bread']  
Recommendation: eggs (if supported by rule base)

## Requirements

Install all dependencies using:  
pip install pandas mlxtend
